# Swift OOP Challenges

## Challenges
### 1 - The bakery

The Warsaw bakery called "Cukiernia - ACC" is famous of it's donuts. It has 2 different kinds of those (standard - 2zł, extra large - 3.5zł) and each can be served with a different topping (cranberry/blueberry/raspberry/straberry jam, nutella - 1zł). The overal price of the donut equals to the price of donut itself + the price of topping (can be more than one). Due limited number of exclusive donuts the bakery can sell one donut at a time.

**Goal**: implement the bakery, donut, topping, order abstractions reflecting the above case.

### 2 - The cruise ship

Four hundred people were traveling on a cruise ship with two engines having power of: 2kHP, 4kHP. Fifty people represented the ship crew while others were tourists. The ship could have both engines operating simultaniosly, only one at a time or keep both off depending on the captain command.
Every tourist was assigned to a two or four person cabin shared with our tourists, which could be his friends. The ship had a restaurant and a two bars of 300, 50 ,50 people capacity correspondigly. Each tourist could visit one of the attractions or stay and his cabin at a time. Tourists under 18 years were not allowed to enter the bar.
